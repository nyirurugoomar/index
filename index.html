      		<h2>ZEBRA 🦓</h2>
			<p>
			Zebras are single-hoofed animals that are native to Africa. Zebras are very closely related to horses and donkeys; in fact, they are in the same genus, Equus. The most prominent feature of zebras is the bold patterns on their coats.</br>
			</br>

			Zebras are generally thought to have white coats with black or brown stripes, according to the San Diego Zoo, because the stripes end at their bellies and the inner side of the legs, which are white. However, zebras have black skin under their white coats! </br>
			Each species of zebra has a different general pattern of stripes. The Grevy's zebra has very thin stripes. The mountain zebra has vertical stripes on its neck and torso, but horizontal stripes on its haunches. Some subspecies of plains zebras have brownish "shadow" stripes between the black stripes, according to the San Diego Zoo.</br>
	        </br>

			It is believed that the zebra's stripes work like camouflage, according to the National Geographic. When zebras stand together, it is harder for predators to determine how many zebras are in the group. The stripes may also make the zebra appear unattractive to smaller predators, such as bloodsucking horseflies, which can spread disease. In addition, the stripes may work as a natural sunscreen.

				<h2>Characteristics of Zebra</h2>
			</center>

			
	<ol>

		<li>
			<h2>Population Location</h2>
		</li>

			<p>Burchell's zebras inhabit savannas in East Africa, in a variety of landscapes
			 from grasslands to woodlands. Grevy's are mostly found now only in Northern Kenya.</br> 
			The mountain zebra lives in Southern and Southwestern Africa.</p>

		<li>
		    <h2>Communal Behavior</h2>
		</li>

			<p>Burchell's zebras roam in organized social groups led by a stallion, which cares for a small group of mares and their foals. The mares remain together even after the stallion dies and is replaced by another. Males form bonds with other males and very large groups will migrate together, led by the oldest females, to find new sources of grass and water. The Grevy's zebras are, instead, solitary and claim territory and mate with the females whom they encounter within that territory.</p>
			<li>
				<h2>Species</h2>
			</li>
			<p>There are three species of zebra in Africa. The most populous is the plains, or Burchell's, zebra. The other two species are Grevy's, which is named for an 1880s French president who received one of the zebras as a gift, and the mountain zebra. The Grevy's zebra now competes with livestock for water resources as agricultural land has taken over much of its natural habitat. According to the African Wildlife Foundation, the Grevy's zebras now number approximately 2,500; a few decades ago 15,000 of them existed.
